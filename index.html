So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

                As part of an unprecedented push to cut the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and create new jobs as the United States shifts toward cleaner energy, Biden directed agencies across the federal government to invest in low-income and minority communities that have traditionally borne the brunt of pollution.</p>

            <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="download.jpeg">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The climate crisis is one of the foremost challenges facing the United States and the world today. In recognition of the severity of this global threat, President Joe Biden used his first day in office to rejoin the Paris Agreement, restore a series of public health and environmental rules, and cancel the permit to the Keystone XL oil pipeline.

                As part of the “After the Apocalypse” series — a set of policy recommendations to help guide us out of a time that has frequently felt like the end of the world — Inkstick asked Dominique Browning, Kate Guy, Josh Gellers, and Elsie Fukofuka how the Biden administration should continue to respond to this threat. The climate crisis touches virtually every aspect of our lives and the recommendations reflect the broad range of domestic and international efforts needed, from reducing climate pollution to financially supporting front-line, vulnerable communities.</p>

                    <p class="p_modal">Stax Stonecutter has lived a peaceful—if unremarkable—life in his small town in the Overworld. The son of great adventurers and wise builders, Stax prefers an easier life. He loves to tend to his gardens and play with his cats all day, rather than venturing out to explore the surrounding lands. It’s quiet on his estate, even lonely sometimes, but it suits Stax well enough.

                        His solitude is shattered when a mysterious stranger arrives with a band of merciless raiders. In one terrible night, Stax’s old life is taken from him, and he is left stranded in the middle of nowhere, angry and alone. He’s never left home, and now he knows why: everything beyond the boundaries of his little town is scary and dangerous! But as he begins his long journey back, Stax encounters fascinating travelers who show him that there’s more to the Overworld than marauding pirates and frightening mobs; there are beautiful lands to explore, fantastical contraptions to build, and new friends to meet. It may have taken losing everything he once knew, but on his adventure Stax finds something more valuable than all the diamonds in the Overworld: a whole wonderful world that’s just waiting to be explored.</p>
